  Hi! My name is [Yavor](about/), pronounced as <code>/'jɑvoR/</code>, spelled "Явор" in Bulgarian and meaning <strong>sycamore</strong>.

  I am a software engineer, currently building [deployment services and tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk-tOPicq78) at scale. I also like [cycling](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/paris-barcelona-on-a-bike), good coffee, guitars and books about where people are headed.

  Here you can find random [things I've done or written](bits-and-bytes) whenever I've had time and inspiration.
