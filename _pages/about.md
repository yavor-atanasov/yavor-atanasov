My experience has taught me to adapt to any technology - languages, frameworks and platforms are tools for achieving a goal. However, that doesn't mean I underestimate their learning curves, idioms and idiosyncrasies.

These days I mostly use python, javascript (both client and server side) and Ruby, PHP and Java when required. I generally get more excited about service architecture and APIs and less about language.
