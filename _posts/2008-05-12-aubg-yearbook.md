Doing the design and layout of the yearbook for the American University in Bulgaria was real pleasure and honor, especially when I was one of the graduating students.

This project was a serious and tedious task since the yearbook was 74 pages, but it was also one of the most rewarding projects I have done. What you see here is the yearbook cover. It is a collage containing different elements and symbols that will always remind the graduates of the most exciting four years of their lives. Not all symbols are so obvious...for some of them you need to look closer! :)
