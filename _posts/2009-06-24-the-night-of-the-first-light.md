The Night of the First Light is a 3D animation I did with a couple of colleagues of mine from the Digital Media course, Björgvin Ívar Guðbrandsson and Dögg Lára Sigurgeirsdóttir.

It was a very enjoyable and great learning experience. It gave me the chance to explore almost all aspects of 3D animation - modelling, lighting, rigging, animating, scripting, rendering etc.

All the work was done on 3Ds Max and the frames were rendered via the Mental Ray renderer. Although all the hard work is done and all frames are rendered, we still need to do some editting in order to completely finish the short film. The animation as a whole is intended for stereoscopic showing.
